						<h4 class="featurette-heading">Summary</h4>
						<p>
							Rent has 6 lead characters but the characters that the story really centers around is Mark, a filmmaker and Roger a a rock musician. Mark and Roger are living in poverty with a very harsh landlord who was a former roommate, Benny. Collins a bisexual friend of the two who is currently a professor ends up getting mugged, but is later found by a cross-dressing street drummer who calls herself Angel. The two of them later end up meeting Benny, their landlord, who tells them Maureen, an actress who is also Mark’s former girlfriend is going to be speaking in an upcoming protest against his plans to evict the homeless for his own personal gain. He tells them if they can convince her otherwise they can stay in the tenants rent-free. However the two refuse. Throughout much of the first act onwards themes of hopelessness, denial, fear and connection surfaces between the characters. Collins and Angel who are both HIV positive end up falling in love with each other. Roger on the other hand is fearful of dying from AIDS. Starting from the second act onwards Mark ends up getting a job offer from the tabloid news due to his participation in the riot. Benny tries to call a truce after his girlfriend Mimi, his former girlfriend, convinced him to rekindle with the cast. Currently at this point Roger and Mimi were going out yet, the relationships that have been setting forth starts becoming strained as time passes by. Multiple causes for this are drug abuse, controlling behavior and mannerism related to the psychology of the characters. Things start to go downhill for the characters from here onwards as Mimi and Rogers breakup and so does Joanne and Maurice. And as if things couldn’t get worse, Angel dies. The whole group starts breaking up, and the remaining friends decide to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other.

						<p>
							Sexuality, homelessness, cross-dressing, AIDS and other sexual related diseases, poverty and the problem of the starving artist.
Throughout much of the story there are a wide variety of people with varying sexual preferences that face dilemmas in a society of a time that only accepts heterosexual people.
Homelessness is rampant where much of the characters represented the generation that was coming out of colleges realizing the world wasn’t as easy as they thought it would be.
Cross-dressing is apparent with Angel as it’s very much a part of her identity. And she is accepted as is by Collins, who loves her until the end and dedicates his, well, crime to her where he hacks an atm machine to spew out cash if they enter the code A-N-G-E-L.
Sexual diseases were running rampantly during the 90s most notably AIDS where a lot characters for suffering from HIV or AIDS, and some paid the ultimate price like Angel.
Poverty and the starving artists is what we are reminded of whenever we see Roger and Collins. Life does not go as they expect and for most people it doesn’t. But like the rest of the characters they persevere.
